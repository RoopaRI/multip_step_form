Multi-Step Form with React

Objective:
Create a responsive multi-step form with three steps, ensuring data validation, error handling, and navigation controls using React.js. The form should persist data to local storage and enforce sequential completion of steps.

Features:
1. Form Structure:
    Implement a multi-step form with three steps:
    Step 1: Personal Information (Name, Email, Phone)
    Step 2: Address Information (Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Zip Code)
    Step 3: Confirmation (Review all entered data)
2. Navigation and Buttons:
    Tabbed navigation to switch between steps.
    Disable the back button on the first step.
    Disable the next button on the last step and replace it with a submit button.
3. Validation:
    Implement client-side validation to ensure all fields are filled before allowing navigation to the next step.
    Display appropriate error messages if fields are empty or invalid (e.g., email format).
    Highlight the fields with errors.
4. Local Storage:
    Persist entered data to local storage when the user navigates between steps.
    Retrieve and pre-fill form fields if the user revisits the form.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
